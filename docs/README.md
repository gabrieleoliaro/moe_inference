# Docs
This folder contains our documentation. For now, we have docs on the frameworks we are benchmarking, as well as the pretrained MoE checkpoint from Fairseq

## Inference frameworks
You can check out the pages below:
- Fairseq platform: [fairseq_moe](./fairseq_moe.md)
- DeepSpeed-MoE platform: [deepspeed_moe](./deepspeed_moe.md)
- FasterTransformer platform: [faster_transformers_moe](./faster_transformers_moe.md)

## Pretrained checkpoints

Check out our docs on Fairseq's 15B-parameters LM MoE model: [en_moe_lm_15b.md](./en_moe_lm_15b.md)

## Generating Inference Request traces

The docs on how we generate the traces of inference requests, as well as the solutions from how other existing works: [inference_request_traces.md](./inference_request_traces.md)
